Jonathan Bei, a Cybersecurity Consultant/Penetration Tester from Singapore.

I love breaking things, finding security vulnerabilities and unintended backdoors into applications, being able to advise my clients on the potential threats to their systems. I am offensive security OSCP and CREST certified.
