# $ whoami?

I am Jonathan Bei, a Cybersecurity Consultant/Penetration Tester from Singapore.

I love breaking things, finding security vulnerabilities and unintended backdoors into applications, being able to advise my clients on the potential threats to their systems. 

I am also passionate about music, creating some of my own tunes from time to time.
